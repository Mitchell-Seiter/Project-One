Hi Karrien and Dahlia,

I hope you all have been doing well. 

I wanted to touch base with you both and provide some updates with the information I have found out thus far. I have been combing through the MTA data like we discussed and have been isolating the busiest subway stations in NYC. 

As you can see below, some of our usual suspects, Herald SQ, Grand Central, and Penn Station, have been experiencing the heaviest traffic. This is for the time period of April through June of this year.

Also what might be a little more interesting to you both are days that experience the most traffic. It would seem that the beginning and ending of the week seem to be the slowest, with Wednesday through Saturday being the busiest days.

I do want to continue sifting through this data to see if I can isolate what stations are closest to college campuses, to try and target the key demographics you were hoping to get. 

I have started this a little bit already and saw that the Fulton St Station is closest to Pace University, and Canal St (ranked No. 11) is closest to an NYU campus. 

I will get back to you again this Friday with my final thoughts and conclusions, but please do not hesitate to reach out before that time with any additional questions. 

Kind regards,

Mitchell
