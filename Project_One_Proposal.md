Hi Karrien and Dahlia, 


My name is Mitchell and I would like to thank you for reaching out to Metis about your case! I definitely believe
we will be able to help you with your problem and be able to maximize the use of your resources to reach 
the greatest amount of people in NYC. 

Using data from [NYC Turnstiles](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and some [demographics data](https://guides.newman.baruch.cuny.edu/nyc_data/nbhoods) I believe we can isolate the areas that will be most heavily used by people, when they are in use, and that would be most interested in supporting your gala and organization. The two data sets just mentioned can provide us with the turnstiles/stations that are most heavily used, when they are in use, where they are located, and a good estimate of the demographics of who is using them. 

If you could please answer the following questions this will help greatly in being able to figure out how to best assist you and your organiztion:

**1. How many people will your team consist of to be able to collect signatures at a given time?**

**2. Will your team attempt to collect signatures every day of the week or just some of the days?**

**3. Are there any key demographics you are hoping to target? (eg women, college educated, specific minorities etc)**

Having this information to the questions above we will be able to further isolate the most heavily trafficked stations in NYC for which days your teams will be the most active, and for which ones should have the most amount of people that you are hoping to get support from. 

If you are unable to provide answers to these questions, that is okay! I will still be able to provide some very in-depth information about where and when stations are most often used. 

Using SQL and Python tools I predict I will be able to provide a minimum viable product (MVP) by as early as next Tuesday that will show some of the highest trafficked stations, what times they are active, and in what areas those stations are located. I should be able to provide some accompanying charts and graphs to help display this data and make it easier to understand. 

Please let me know if this all sounds acceptable and if there is anything else you would be interested in seeing. Or if there are any other questions that you may have. 

Kind regards,

Mitchell C. Seiter
